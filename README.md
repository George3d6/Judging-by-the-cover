# Judging by the cover

Trying to see if movie ratings on rotten tomatoes be be predicted or at least estimated using the poster of the
movie (chosen via ranking on google images).

## State

Currently using multi-layer perceptrons and suprot vectort machines with some custom tuning for Sklearn, nor the
classification neither the regression is doing much good.

Granted, the problem may just be impossible to solve, but it's possible that a CNN or something else that's more
specific to image classification may work, changing the input shape may also help.
